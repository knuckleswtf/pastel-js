# Introduction

Welcome to the Kittn API! You can use our API to can get information on various cats, kittens, and breeds in our database.

As you scroll, you'll see code examples for working with the API in Bash, PHP, Python, and JavaScript in the dark area to the right (or as part of the content on mobile), and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right (or from the nav menu at the top left on mobile).

This example API documentation page was borrowed from [Slate](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate) and generated with [Pastel](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/pastel). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```php
# With PHP, you can pass in the correct header with each request
$client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client();
$response = $client->get(
    "api_endpoint_here",
    [
        'headers' => [
            'Authorization' => 'meowmeowmeow',
        ],
    ]
);
$body = $response->getBody();
print_r(json_decode((string) $body));
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```bash
# With Bash, you pass in the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
